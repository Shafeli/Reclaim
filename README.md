# Reclaim

**Reclaim** is a tribal language revitalization game designed to reconnect Indigenous youth with their ancestral language, stories, and culture. Blending traditional oral knowledge with modern tools, Reclaim creates an interactive space to learn through voice, storytelling, and play.

## 🌱 Purpose

This project was created as a way to:

- Preserve and pass on endangered tribal languages
- Give youth an engaging way to learn through games
- Build a platform where community voices—especially elders—can be heard
- Foster pride, identity, and connection through culture

## 🎮 Vision

Reclaim isn’t just a game—it's a cultural tool. Language is more than vocabulary; it carries worldview, history, and belonging. Our goal is to help players:

- Learn their language through voice-based interactions
- Explore traditional stories and knowledge
- Participate in a living, evolving archive of cultural material
- Contribute to language preservation with tools for families and communities

## 📦 Features (Planned)

- 🔊 Elder voice clips for vocabulary and pronunciation
- 🧠 Memory and quiz games to reinforce language learning

## ⚒️ Tech Stack (WIP)

- **Engine**: Unity (with UI Toolkit)
- **Platform**: Desktop and Mobile (Android/iOS)
- **Data**: JSON-based content system with localization

## ✨ Status

Currently in early pre-production — prototyping UI, shaping core gameplay loops, and building content pipelines. The goal is to keep things modular, extensible, and respectful of community input.

## 🧭 Guiding Values

- **Respect**: Language and stories are sacred. Everything is done in partnership with culture-bearers and with permission.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for learners of all ages and tech skill levels.
